## Implementation Checklist

This is the standard checklist for getting your app integrated with the current
SDK.

Follow the [installation guide][]:

- Install the desired NationBuilder app for your nation, ex: `NBClientExample`

- Add the SDK to your Podfile
  - Fetch and import the SDK (`NBClient/Main.h`, `NBClient/UI.h`)

- Update your app's info plist
  - \(Optional\) add the `Fonts provided by application` item if using the UI component

Follow the [accounts usage guide][]:

- Update your app's info plist
  - Add the `URL types/0/URL identifier` as `com.nationbuilder.oauth`
  - Add the `URL types/0/URL Schemes/0` as the path for the NationBuilder 
    app's redirect URI

- Create and populate `NationBuilder-Info.plist`

- Create an `NBAccountButton`
  - Link it to the accounts manager
  - Add it to your view controller

- Create an `NBAccountsManager`
  - Implement `NBAccountsManagerDelegate`

- Create an `NBAccountsViewController`
  - Link it to the accounts manager
