# Contributing to NationBuilder iOS SDK

## Questions & Feature Requests

If you have questions, feature requests, or any other kind of feedback, please
seek us out on the NationBuilder [iOS developer forum][]. __Please do not__
create issues for them.

## Bugs & Improvements

We highly welcome bug reports and general refinements (that don't introduce new
functionality). Please create issues and pull requests for them, respectively.
For both, please neatly and thoroughly describe the problem and the steps to
reproduce.

## Features

If you have new features you want added to the main repository, please create a
pull request and neatly describe your changes in an understandable (and
hopefully not too long) series of commits.

You are also expected to write passing tests for your features. We currently use
XCTest and OCMock and expect you to not introduce new dependencies.

We may also require you to sign a [CLA][].
